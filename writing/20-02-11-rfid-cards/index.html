        <h1>Mobile Programmable Space</h1>
        <p><small>February 11, 2020</small></p>

        <p>I am exploring the idea of "programmable spaces" &mdash; where the concept of a computer is expanded outside a little
        rectangular screen to fill the entire room. Interacting with the programmable space means using physical objects, not
        virtual ones on a screen. Bringing computing to scale of a room makes it a communal and social experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            When describing programmable spaces to other people I usually end up saying "you just have to see it in person." My previous
            explorations have relied on room installations of cameras and projectors and careful calibration so I rarely transported
            the system. I wondered what the "minimum viable demo" was and if the programmable space idea could be
            simplified and made mobile without loosing its emergent properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            A common idea throughout all of my programmable space explorations has been the physical manifestation of code &mdash; mainly
            source code printed on full size pieces of paper and annotated with dots so cameras could track the papers.
            For a minimum viable demo, the code needed to be small, portable, and easy to sense without much setup or calibration.
            Tabletop card games seemed like a good parallel: they
            are portable, familiar, and can have complex rule systems built up from effects described on the cards themselves. I
            also like games as parallel for learning in the hopes that the programmable space would be designed for play and self guided
            exploration and not "serious matters".
        </p>
        <p>
            In this attempt at a "minimum viable programmable space", programs are represented physically by RFID cards
            in a plastic sleeve with the program source code printed on receipt paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            <center><img src="when-see-card.jpg" /></center>
        </p>
        <p>
            Programs are run when they are placed on a stand that has a RFID sensor behind it.
            One of the core ideas of the programmable space is that all code should be out in the room and shown in a way that people can read the code and learn what is going on. The
            receipt paper code helps people understand what a program does and the RFID card helps the computers know what the program does.
            This setup is similar to my <a href="https://haiperspace.com/writing/19-03-17-programmable-space/">March 2019 exploration</a> that
            used full sized pieces of papers and clipboards.
        </p>

                The entire setup on a desk.
            </small>
            </center>
        </p>

        <p>
            The picture above shows the entire layout of the demo. In the middle are the orange program sensors &mdash; when a program is placed on them
            then its code is run. On the left is the program editor: When a program is placed on the left-most sensor, its
            source code is shown on the editor. When a new version of a program's code is saved, it is printed out on the
            receipt printer to the left of the editor. On the right screen is a list of all the facts and subscriptions for
            running programs: this is tool to understand the inputs and outputs of the room without having to read all the
            code. In the middle of the desk is a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333">Circuit Playground Express</a> &mdash; an electronic board with lights, buttons, and sensors
            built in. Its buttons, light sensors, lights, and speaker is connected to the room.
        </p>

                <img src="masterlist.png" />
                <div>
                    <small>
                        The list of running programs and their subscriptions and claims to the room.
                    </small>
                </div>
            </center>
        </p>

        <p>
            But this demo was more constrained than my other programmable space demos and I wondered if the idea could be compressed
            this small. Only a few programs could run at the same time and the only physical inputs and outputs where on
            the same little electronic board. Maybe it needed the emergent properties of being room-scale to make sense.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have also thought a lot about the idea from Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen's
            essay <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/#serious-work">How can we develop
            transformative tools for thought?</a> where they
            differentiate an <i>education media</i> and <i>canonical media</i>. Educational media may be simple and easy, but is not
            used by a serious professional to do real work. On the hand, canonical media
            "expand[s] its range, and set a new standard widely known amongst creators in that medium". My aspiration for this
            project is not to create a toy, but be a medium that surpasses current limitations of how technology can live naturally in
            a space while also empowering more people to create and think with computers.
        </p>

        <p>
            I tested the minimum prograble space with a couple people to see if it was a hint of the future or just a toy. The test was
            designed to introduce the system to someone that had written some code (not necessarily professionally) through a collaborative explanation. The goal was to see how quickly they understood the system and if they were able to
            get past the technology challenges and into creative play.

            and then putting it on a stand.

            The goal is that people in the space can pick up a program and get a sense of what it does.

        <h4>Lessons Learned:</h4>
        <p>
            Most things worked well and this demo confirmed a programmable space system can be portable while still being interesting.
        </p>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>It was quick to go from no code to understanding and making something new. Making a first program took about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>The list of programs and their claims and subscriptions was an effective tool for understanding the capabilities of the room.
                It served the dual role of explaining the capabilities of the room to new people and helping debug new programs being made.
            </li>
            <li>Receipt paper was a good fit for programs. It was fast to print and easily disposable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But some things weren't great:</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                Length of code is very limited and words often wrap lines in an ugly way.
                The receipt printer I used was limited to 32 characters wide.

                    <center><img src="long-receipt.jpg" /></center>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Having the output limited to just the Circuit Playground board made this demo just a toy.
                I missed having some graphical or textual display.</li>
            <li>Besides having short programs, the demo did not help people avoid classic programming mistakes
                like syntax errors and misspelled variable names.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Overall, card-size programs seem like a promising directions for informal objects that can live in a home. I think it is important that the system
            be always running so that it can be normally ignored but then used immediately. Projectors and cameras are a lot "tech"
            to have always on inside a home and I have always been turning them off.
            I have the similiar feelings about VR and AR: they aren't something I want to have on all the time.
            This RFID card system was the first prototype I noticed myself leaving on and <i>ignoring</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm curious how the RFID card's ideas will scale up to multiple rooms.
            Going beyond one room is an existing milestone in my vision to have the technology live everywhere while also bring challenges of
            multi-room coordination. For example, how to multiple rooms share code between each other? I foresee the need for a way
            for cards to transform sizes or sensing modes (ex: transforming a card program into a full size paper) so code longer than a card can be written.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tabletop card game parallel also makes me want to make a social and room-scale board game using this card system.
