        <h1>Mobile Programmable Space</h1>
        <p><small>February 11, 2020</small></p>

        <p>I am exploring the idea of "programmable spaces" &mdash; where the concept of a computer is expanded outside a little
        rectangular screen to fill the entire room. Interacting with the programmable space means using physical objects, not
        virtual ones on a screen. Bringing computing to scale of a room makes it a communal and social experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            In describing programmable spaces to other people I end up saying "you just have to see it in person". My previous
            explorations have relied on room installations of cameras and projectors and careful calibration so I rarely transported
            the system. I wondered what the "minimum viable demo" was and if the programmable space idea could actually be
            simplified and mobile while still being gradual, room-scale, and multiplayer/social.
        </p>
        <p>
            The minimum viable software also needed a minimum viable medium. Tabletop card games seemed like a good parallel: they
            are portable, familiar, and can have complex rule systems built up from effects described on the cards themselves. I
            also like games as parallel for learning in the hopes that a programmable space would be geared for play and self guided
            exploration and not "business".
        </p>
        <p>
            In this attempt at a "minimum viable programmable space", programs are represented physically by RFID cards with the
            program code printed on receipt paper.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Programs are run when they are placed on a card stand. The idea is that all the
            code should be out in the room and presented in a way that people can read the code and learn what is going on. The
            receipt paper code helps people what what the code does and the RFID card helps the computers know what the card does.
            This setup is similar to my <a href="https://haiperspace.com/writing/19-03-17-programmable-space/">March 2019 exploration</a> that
            used full sized pieces of papers and clipboards.
        </p>

                The entire setup on a desk.
            </small>
        </p>

        <p>
            The picture above shows the entire layout of the demo. In the middle are the code stands - when a card is placed on them
            then the code is run. On the left is the program editor: When a program is placed on the left-most card sensor, it's
            code is shown in the editor. The keyboard is used to edit the code and then a keyboard shortcut saves and causes the new
            version of code to be printed on the receipt paper. On the right is a list of all the facts and subscriptions for
            running programs - this is tool to get a baseline what the inputs and outputs of the room without having to read all the
            code. In the middle on the desk is a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333">Circuit Playground Express</a> - an electronic board with lights, buttons, and sensors
            built in. Its buttons, light sensors, lights, and speaker is connected to the room.

                <div>
                    <small>
                        The list of running programs and their subscriptions and claims to the room.
                    </small>
                </div>
            </center>
        </p>

        <p>
            But this demo was more constrained that other programmable space demos and I wondered if the idea could be compressed
            this small. Programs only a few programs could run at the same time and the only physical inputs and outputs where on
            the same little electronic board. Maybe it needed the emergent properties of being room-scale to make sense.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have also thought a lot about the idea from Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen's
            essay <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/#serious-work">How can we develop
            transformative tools for thought?</a> where they
            differentiate an education media and <i>canonical media</i>. Educational media may be simple and easy, but would never be
            used by a serious professional to do real world work. On the other end of the spectrum is the canonical media that
            "expand[s] its range, and set a new standard widely known amongst creators in that medium". My aspiration for this
            project is not to create a toy, but be a medium that surpasses limit limitations of how technology can live naturally in
            a space while also empowering more people to create and think with computers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore I tested this idea with couple people to see if it was a hint of the future or just a toy. The test was
            structured to someone that had written some code (not necessarily a professionally) and to introduce them to the system
            through an interactive explanation. The goal was to see how quickly they understood the system and if they were able to
            get past the technology aspects to creative play.
        </p>

        <h3 id="test-procedure">Test Procedure:</h3>
        <p>I showed how a card on a stand claims a fact. See it's effect on the masterlist in green.</p>
        <p>I showed how a card on a stand can listen for facts. See the things it is listening for in red.</p>
        <p>I then had them write their first program to use a capability of the room. This involves looking at the masterlist and
        fulfilling one of the capabilities of the room. Take an empty code off the stack, write code, print code and put on
        card, run.</p>
        <p>Have them read a card to test of legibility of code and receipt paper medium</p>
        <p>Play using buttons, lights, etc.</p>
        <p>Demo of how state can be persisted: Button press counter example</p>

        <h4>Lessons Learned:</h4>
        <p>
            Some things worked well:
        </p>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>Very quick to go from no code to understanding and making something new.</li>
            <li>Masterlist was an effective tool for understanding the capabilities of a system. Explanation of how things work would
            normally come from other people, but it is a useful baseline inspector and debugging tool.</li>
            <li>Receipt paper was ok for short demo code. No code written ran out of space.</li>
            <li>This confirmed the system can be portable while still being fun.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But some things weren't great:</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
            <li>
                Length of code is very limited and words often wrap lines in an ugly way
                <br/>
                <p>
                    <center><img src="long-receipt.jpg" /></center>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Very limited outputs that can be explored too quickly.
                Many traditional tests of GUIs involve displaying text, that was totally missing in this demo but would be useful.</li>
            <li>Some critical parts were too slow â†’ RFID sensing, web display, circuit playground update via UART</li>
            <li>No display of errors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Overall, card-size programs seem like a promising directions for informal objects that can live around a home. I think it is important that the system
            be always running so that people can be ignored normally but then used immediately. Projectors and cameras are a lot of
            to have always on inside a home and personally I have always been turning them off. This is the first system I noticed
            myself leaving on and <i>ignoring</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel confident enough for to expand the system to scale up this demo and extend the system to multiple rooms. This is
            both an exiting new milestone in my goal to have the technology live everywhere while also bring challenges of
            multi-room coordination. For example, how to multiple rooms share code between each other? Now see the need for a way
            for cards to transform sizes or sensing modes (ex: transforming a card program into a full size paper) so code longer than a card can be written.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tabletop card game metaphor also makes me want to make a board game using the system. I look forward to game jams
            using this version of programmable space.
