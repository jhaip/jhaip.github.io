<h1>Programmable Space - Research Update</h1>
<p><small>January 11, 2019</small></p>
<p>
I am interested in blurring the boundary between the digital and the physical, and making it easier for everyone to do
this as well.
</p>
<p>
Previously, I was working on a tools for seeing<sup><a href="https://medium.com/@jhaip/seeing-space-89104020793">1</a></sup>
and
to help tell a more
complete story of the making process<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqK2nMTE90g">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
But I heard of <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">Dynamicland</a> and thought it would address of the
limitations that bothered me about the seeing tools I was making. Dynamicland is a communal computer, designed for
agency, not apps, where people can think like whole humans. Dynamicland puts the computer into the room instead in a
tiny box of pixels. In my seeing tools, it felt wrong to put a tool meant to help people see on a screen when the
primary work was going on in the room. Also I wondered how people would make custom visualizations. I have a background
in data visualization so I could quickly write code to make a custom graph of data but generally this would be
challenging. My seeing tool relied primarily on pre-made visualizations and there was a bad jump in complexity and
knowledge if you wanted to extend the system. I liked that Dynamicland's generic programming model made it equally easy
to make graphics, robots, and improve the system itself.
</p>

</p>
<p>
I wanted to judge the merit of these ideas for myself but Dynamicland is a building in Oakland, CA where the physical
building and the coding environment are one in the same. Dynamicland is not an app that can be downloaded and run in a
new space. A new space with new people should develop a system that works best for them.
</p>
<p>
I tried out a couple open-source projects related to "programmable spaces"&mdash;<a href="https://paperprograms.org/">Paper Programs</a> by <a href="http://janpaulposma.nl/">JP Posma</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/living-room">Living Room</a> by the Recurse Center.
Both were impressively complete but I felt both
were too closely tied to JavaScript and using a web browser. Programming was still done on a computer or in a web
browser. I also felt both had too strong of a difference between the programs you could make with the system, and the
system code itself.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, I started to make my own "programmable space" where everything in the system would be done in the room
without needing to switch back to a traditional programming experience on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">OS</a>.
</p>
<p>
Initially I tried to use a Dynamicland-like setup with cameras and projectors pointing at papers with colored dots.
Each paper was an independent program. Papers in the room would have code written on them. If the paper was out in the
room, then anyone in the room could look at the paper and read what it does. Likewise, if the paper was out in the room
then the cameras could see it (using the colored dots) and cause the paper's code to run. The one-to-one mapping
between what people can see and what programs were running helps the system be understandable. Projectors would project
the output of the programs on the paper as nonintrusive display. The text editor used to edit papers was itself another
paper you would point that the program you want to edit.
</p>
<p>
Programs interact by:
<ul class="dashed">
<li>Stating facts about the world. Facts are any normal sentence like "The temperature is 20 C". Facts are stored in a
global "tuplespace". This idea is similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)">LINDA coordination language</a>.
I inherited this metaphor from the <a href="https://livingroomresearch.tumblr.com/post/171022587132/living-room-in-context">Living Room</a>
project.
</li>
<li>
Subscribing to facts in the world said by other programs using fill-in-the-blank sentences like "When the temperature
is X", run some code using the variable X. This way of matching data is close to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This setup worked but was hard to make reliable and keep physically rearranged. The cameras and projectors never felt
invisible. The point of the programmable room was to forget about them like you forget about the lights in your
ceiling. I was also spending too much time on the code to run the camera and projectors and not spending enough time on
the thing I cared about - learning what it's like to work in a programmable room.
</p>
<p>
To refocus, I scaled back and made a limited but complete demo of a programmable room with a complete editing
experience outside a traditional GUI OS.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/3744a449aeab4e91b432bfd74135d8de#f06879fefc7f46e1b2f82b3dfdc7d818" />
</p>
<p>
The room had an always on text-editor and a grid of 9 editable programs. The papers were fixed on the wall, so I
avoided needing a camera to detect papers. The fixed papers also made the projector easy to set up. Having 9 pre-made
programs avoided the issue of updating and creating the physical papers.
</p>
<p>
After playing around for a few days, I discovered that the room did give promising looking at what it would be like to
have a programmable room.
<ul class="dashed">
<li>
The always-on text editor, live reloading programs, and a easy and extensible language for communicating between
things in the room felt like the right format to orchestrate the multiple things running in the room. It was very
satisfying to see something in the room respond within a couple seconds just as easily as I had done only on a screen
in the past.
</li>
<li>
Besides the dropdown to select what program to edit, the room was successfully a stable and complete editing
experience away from a GUI OS. It was refreshing to remove all distracting apps.
</li>
<li>
I am happy that the 9 editable programs are very similar and live in the same extensible system as the programs used
to bootstrap the system. Although the boot papers weren't editable in this version, they exist, and in the future there
can be a gentle transition between making fun programs and editing the system itself. I think this is the key idea to
making the space work best for the specific place and people that work inside it.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/3744a449aeab4e91b432bfd74135d8de#7441a3bfa60a488283e6a3016f03e61f" />
</p>

<p>
But some limitations hurt the experience:
<ul class="dashed">
    <li>
Selecting a program to edit using a website dropdown was a useful compromise for this demo but it doesn't make sense
to use a web page just to select something in a room. A better alternative to selecting an option from a list is a
physical object like a dial. This was a good example of how mixing existing computer systems and the programmable room
doesn't work well - you are either in one medium or the other.
</li>
<li>
The code is too closely tied to existing programming languages. It reads and looks like code instead of prose. There
is no clear separation between the systems language (how things in the room talk) and the logic-level code.
</li>
<li>
Having the editor away from the code. The screen displaying the code editor was on the desk at a different angle than
the 9 paper grid. Because it was just me sitting in a swivel chair in a small room this wasn't too annoying but it felt
wrong. Like going somewhere else to edit instead of editing in the context of the programs.
</li>
<li>
Errors in the code weren't displayed. I got by because I was familiar with the system, the language, the code, and
because the programs were short. I would often get the wording of facts or subscriptions wrong. ("Wish light strand was
blue" vs "Wish lights are blue")
</li>
<li>
The room was set up with Information displays on the walls and people sitting in the middle looking at the wall. This
is the "command center" setup. To make the system more social and collaborative it should be the opposite: information
in the middle with people crowded around it in small groups.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, I want to addressing the following things in the future to make the system more natural:
<ul class="dashed">
<li>Replace the website dropdown but a physical object for selecting things like a dial.</li>
<li>Making the code more human friendly via a custom pre-parser so the code looks less like code.</li>
</ul>
</p>
