    <h1>Multi-touch Screens</h1>
    <p><small>2009 &ndash; 2011</small></p>
    <p>
        After watching a video of Jeff Han's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEVYwa-vHM">wallâ€“sized multi-touch screen</a>,
        I wanted my own. I started frequenting the <a href="http://nuigroup.com/forums">Natural User Interface Forums</a> and was
        introduced to the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">Human&ndash;computer interaction</a> research.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last version I made was desk-sized and used <a href="https://mrl.nyu.edu/~jhan/ftirsense/">frustrated total internal reflection</a> to detect touches.

    <p>A cheap first prototype was made from a torn apart computer monitor and two infrared lasers with plane lenses
        sitting on top of a carboard box. A modified PS3 Eye webcam at the bottom of the box could see the reflected IR light
        from fingers when touching the screen. Image processing software turned the camera's image into mouse clicks.
